# FizzBuzz Tech Test 

To complete the challenge clone the following repo and implement the FizzBuzz Kata either using .NET or Node. We've provided some skeleton code to get you started but feel free to use your own.

# FizzBuzz
The objective of Fizzbuzz is to create a program with the following specification:

The program can be passed a number.

When passed a number that is a multiple of 3, the program returns the message 'Fizz'.  
When passed a number that is a multiple of 5, the program returns the message 'Buzz'.  
When passed a number that is a multiple of both 3 and 5, the program ignores the previous 2 rules and returns the message 'Fizzbuzz'.  
In all other cases, the program simply returns the given number.
